# RecordApp Compilation Fixes

## Summary
This document details the fixes made to resolve compilation errors after the codebase cleanup and utility class consolidation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PdfUtils Implementation Issues
- **Problem**: After consolidating PdfGenerator and PdfExporter into PdfUtils, references in ExpenseViewModel were incorrect.
- **Solution**: Updated method calls in ExpenseViewModel to use the correct static companion object methods or instance methods:
  - Changed from `pdfUtils.generateExpensesPdf()` to `PdfUtils.generateExpensesPdf()`
  - Updated similar method calls for `generateSingleExpensePdf` and `generatePdfByFolder`

### 2. Missing Method Implementation
- **Problem**: The `generateImageGridPdf` method was referenced in ExpenseViewModel but not implemented in PdfUtils.
- **Solution**: Added a complete implementation of this method to PdfUtils as a companion object method with proper grid layout logic.

### 3. Variable Reassignment Error
- **Problem**: In the `generateImageGridPdf` method, a `val` was being reassigned when creating new tables for page breaks.
- **Solution**: Changed the declaration from `val table` to `var table` to allow reassignment.

### 4. CsvUtils Method Calls
- **Problem**: After consolidating CsvGenerator and CsvExporter, ExpenseViewModel was calling methods that no longer existed.
- **Solution**: Updated method calls to use the new CsvUtils companion object methods:
  - Added `generateExpensesCsv` and `generateCsvByFolder` static methods to CsvUtils
  - Updated ExpenseViewModel to call these methods properly

## Testing Results
- All compilation errors have been resolved
- The app builds successfully
- Unit tests pass without errors
- The application maintains all original functionality with the consolidated utility classes

## Remaining Notes
- There are some deprecation warnings in the UI components that could be addressed in a future update
- The consolidated utility classes should have unit tests added for better code coverage
